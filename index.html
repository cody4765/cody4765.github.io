      <h2 class="text-center">Oregon Tech and the University of Portland have joined forces with the AFROTC!</h2>
      <p>Oregon Tech has joined forces with University of Portland (UP) for a “cross-town” agreement making Air Force
        Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) possible if you attend the Portland-Metro campus (or you are an Online
        student who lives in the Portland-Metro area). This agreement allows you to attend Oregon Tech while
        simultaneously taking AFROTC classes at the University of Portland. The AFROTC General Military Course and/or
        Professional Officer Course is available to qualified students of Oregon Tech who desire to earn appointments as
        commissioned officers in the United States Air Force.</p>
        <p>AFROTC is a 4-year program. If you are admitted as a freshman or will be a sophomore student with four years
          until graduation, AFROTC could work for you! AFROTC scholarship opportunities are outstanding. While
          scholarships favor freshmen who have never attended college, there are also scholarship opportunities available
          for other students in the program. Officers with Engineering, Cybersecurity and other technical degrees are in
          high demand in the Air Force and Space Force, so this partnership with Oregon Tech and UP could offer
          significant scholarship opportunities for prospective cadets. If you're a new college student who is interested 
          in this program click <a href="https://www.afrotc.com/scholarships/high-school/types/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.
        Already attending college and interested in this opportunity? Click <a href="https://www.afrotc.com/scholarships/college/types/" target="_blank">here</a> to see if you qualify for this opportunity!</p>
        <p>If you are interested in joining Air Force ROTC and would like more detailed information, please
          email usaf@oit.edu.</p>
